# GFGPROJECT
Project on Stuttered Speech Recognition System 
Stuttered Speech Recognition System

This project is a speech recognition system designed to recognize and transcribe speech of individuals who stutter. The system is developed using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to recognize stuttered speech patterns, and to accurately transcribe the speech into text.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher

TensorFlow 2.0 or higher

Keras 2.3.1 or higher

PyAudio 0.2.11 or higher

Installing

Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]

Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the program: python stuttered_speech_recognition.py

Usage

Start the program

Speak into the microphone

Wait for the program to transcribe your speech

The program will output the transcribed text in the console

Training

If you want to train the system on a new dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset and store the audio files in a directory

Update the DATASET_PATH variable in stuttered_speech_recognition.py to the path of your dataset directory

Run the train.py file to train the model on your dataset: python train.py

Built With

Python - programming language used

TensorFlow - machine learning framework used

Keras - high-level API for TensorFlow used

PyAudio - audio library used for recording and playback
